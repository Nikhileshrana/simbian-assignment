# Simbian Security Operations Comparison Section Assignment

Developed a modern and interactive section for Simbian Security, allowing users to clearly see the difference between using Simbian Security and not using it. In this section users can compare the difference between using Simbian Security and not using it. The section is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. The section is fully responsive and can be used on mobile, tablet, and desktop. The section is also animated and smooth. The section is also dynamic and can be used to compare different scenarios.

I added multiple components with motion-based animations while maintaining a consistent directory structure and naming convention. I used useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects, setting up the project in a way that's scalable and easy to maintain.

### Areas of Improvement
