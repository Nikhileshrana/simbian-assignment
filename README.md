# Simbian Security Operations Comparison Section Assignment

Developed a modern and interactive section for Simbian Security, allowing users to clearly see the difference between using Simbian Security and not using it. I designed a comparison slider that users can interact with to visualize the improvements Simbian Security provides.

I added multiple components with motion-based animations while maintaining a consistent directory structure and naming convention. I used useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects, setting up the project in a way that's scalable and easy to maintain.
