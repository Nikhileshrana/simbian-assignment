# Simbian Security Operations Comparison Section Assignment

Developed a modern look and feel section for simbian Security. 
where users can see the clear difference between using simbian security or not. I though of creating something that users can interact with so came up with this slider and comparison slider where users can actually see the difference between simbian security and not using simbian security.

i have added multiple components and used motion for animations.where i have maintained consistent directory structure and naming convention. i have added
usestate, useeffect hooks for state management and sideoperations. i have set things up in such a way that it can be easily scalable and maintainable.
